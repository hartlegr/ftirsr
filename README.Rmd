# ftirsr <img src="./data-raw/Sticker/ftiRRRs.png" align="right" height=140/>


The goal of `ftirsr` is to help easily create a Partial Least Squares Regression model to estimate composition of natural compounds such as biogenic silica and total organic carbon in lake sediment core samples. 

## Installation

The development version from GitHub can be accessed like so:

``` {r}
remotes::install_github("sds270-s22/ftirsr")
```

## Examples

```{r example, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ftirsr)
library(tidyverse)
library(pls)

# This shows finding the maximum biogenic silica percentage in the dataset
max(greenland$bsi)
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# This shows how to easily read a directory of FTIRS samples into R while attaching Wet Chemistry values and interpolating onto a vector of rounded wavenumbers for ease of interpretation

my_data <- read_ftirs(dir_path = "~/ftirsr/tests/testthat/test_samples",
                      wet_chem_path = "~/ftirsr/tests/testthat/wet-chem-data.csv")

head(my_data)
```


```{r}
 # This shows pivoting the ftirs dataframe to the wide format necessary to run in a PLS model
my_data_wide <- my_data %>%
  pivot_wider()

# Showing the first 5 columns and the first 10 rows
head(my_data_wide[1:5], 10)
```

```{r}
# It is just as easy to pivot back
# Wet Chem data is included, so we denote that with wet_chem = TRUE
my_data_long <- my_data_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(wet_chem = TRUE)

head(my_data_long)
```

```{r}
# We can confirm that this object is class `ftirs`, which is necessary to access methods, such as predict.ftirs()
is.ftirs(my_data_wide)
```

```{r}
# It is easy to predict the amount of Biogenic Silica in your sample using our model that is trained on 131 arctic lake sediment core samples
preds <- predict(my_data_wide)
preds
```
