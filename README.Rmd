The goal of `ftirsr` is to help easily create a Partial Least Squares Regression model to estimate composition of natural compounds such as biogenic silica and total organic carbon in lake sediment core samples. 

## Installation

The development version from GitHub can be accessed like so:

``` {r}
remotes::install_github("sds270-s22/ftirsr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ftirsr)

# This shows finding the maximum biogenic silica percentage in the dataset
max(greenland$bsi)
```
